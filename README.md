## About Appliction

Integrating Azure Active Directory (AD) for login functionality in a Laravel application provides a seamless and secure authentication experience by leveraging Microsoft's identity management solutions. By using the Laravel Socialite package, developers can easily implement Azure AD login, allowing users to authenticate using their existing Microsoft credentials. This process involves configuring Azure AD to set up an application registration, obtaining necessary client ID and secret keys, and then integrating these credentials into the Laravel application.
